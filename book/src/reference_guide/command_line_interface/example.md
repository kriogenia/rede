# rede example

This command is intended to give a brief help to people starting with
`rede`. In this first version using it will only output a message
with an example of a request- It will also create a file named `example.toml`
with that request. This allows to have a valid request to try the `run` command.

```shell
rede example
rede run example
```

_This command is intended to provide example of different types of
features in the future, but right now it's limited to just this_
