# Installation

As this still an early stage of the project the package repository where it will be provides is cargo, so
you would need to have Rust installed and run:

```shell
cargo install rede
```

Of course, if you have Rust installed you can also build it and/or install it yourself.

Another alternative is to download the latest binary from the
[releases page](https://github.com/kriogenia/rede/releases) but only Linux binary will be available for
the moment.
